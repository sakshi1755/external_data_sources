# PLFS — Cleaned Microdata + Code Maps

This repository converts the official PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey)
unit-level data from MoSPI/NSO into clean per-release CSVs with a canonical
column schema, code-map lookups, and per-release calibrated weights. **11
releases covered, 2018-19 → CY2025** — a continuous year-by-year picture of
India's labour market for the post-COVID/post-AI period.

The final step is loading into BigQuery via [`scripts/load_bq.py`](scripts/load_bq.py)
— one script, six tables, idempotent.

---

## 1. What is PLFS

**PLFS** = **Periodic Labour Force Survey**, run by MoSPI / NSO (Govt of
India). It's the official source for India's employment and unemployment
statistics — where the LFPR / WPR / unemployment rate numbers come from. A
household sample survey covering ~100k households and ~400k–1.1M individuals
per release.

Two release cadences:

- **Annual** (Jul-Jun) — the canonical employment-indicators report. 4 data
  files: `HHV1`/`HHRV` (household first-visit + revisits), `PERV1`/`PERRV`
  (person first-visit + revisits).
- **Calendar Year** (Jan-Dec) — started CY2021. Faster turnaround, first-visit
  only. 2 data files: `CHHV1` + `CPERV1`.

Each survey collects, per person:

- Demographics (age, sex, marital status, relation to head)
- Education (general level, technical level — engineering / medical / other)
- Usual principal activity status (job, industry NIC code, occupation NCO code,
  enterprise type, social security, wages)
- Usual subsidiary activity status (same fields for any second job)
- Current weekly activity status (last 7 days, day-by-day)
- Monthly earnings (regular salaried + self-employment)

Per household:

- Religion, social group (SC/ST/OBC/Other), household type
- Monthly consumer expenditure (the standard income proxy in Indian household
  surveys — PLFS doesn't ask income directly)

PLFS data is published with per-record **sampling weights** so survey counts
scale up to India-wide population estimates (~1.4B).

## 2. What this gets used for

The kinds of questions this dataset answers, drawn from analyses already in
[`analyses/`](analyses/):

- **Engineering jobs longitudinal** — engineering grads age 20-24 in regular
  salaried jobs paying ≥ ₹25k/month, year-by-year from 2018-19 to CY2025,
  split by wage tier (₹25-30k / ₹30-50k / >₹50k). Visible result: a ~25% drop
  in CY2024 → CY2025, the IT-services contraction.
- **Women in IT longitudinal** — same question restricted to NIC 62-63
  (computer programming / information services). How has women's share of
  entry-level IT jobs evolved 2022 → 2025?
- **Education–wages gap** — for engineering grads vs general grads vs school-
  only, what's the median wage at age 25-29 and 35-39?
- **Socio-economic profile of engineering grads** — what % of India's ~9M
  engineering degree holders come from low-income households (HCE proxy)?
  What % are first-generation learners?
- **Underemployment patterns** — ~3-4% of working engineering grads are
  classified as shop salespersons (NCO 522) or office clerks (NCO 411).

## 3. Sources

Single source of truth: **https://microdata.gov.in** (the National Data
Archive run by MoSPI). Each release has a catalog ID:

Plus two non-PLFS reference datasets:

- **NIC 2008** (National Industrial Classification) — from MoSPI. ~2k codes
  organised into divisions / groups / classes / subclasses.
- **NCO 2015** (National Classification of Occupations) — from DGE&T,
  Ministry of Labour. ~2.7k 8-digit codes mapping back to NCO 2004.

### Extraction story

PLFS unit-level data is mostly distributed as `.Nesstar` archives — a
proprietary NSDstat format that requires a Windows GUI app (Nesstar Explorer)
to extract. Catalogs from 2022+ also offer pre-converted CSV downloads. For
older releases we used a one-time GCE Windows VM workflow:

1. Spin up Windows Server 2022 in `asia-south1` (`avantifellows` project)
2. RDP in, install Nesstar Explorer
3. Manually export each `.Nesstar` archive to TSV
4. Push back to a GCS bucket, pull to local
5. Tear down VM + bucket

Total one-time cost: ~₹100. Extracted TSVs and original catalog URLs are in
[`clean/releases.csv`](clean/releases.csv); no need to repeat unless data corrupts.

```

Every step is reproducible from the source URLs in
[`clean/releases.csv`](clean/releases.csv). If a release gets republished or
we add a new year, the only change is in [`scripts/releases.py`](scripts/releases.py)
(single source of truth for release config). The rest re-runs.

```bash
# Build the release registry (clean/releases.csv)
python3 scripts/releases.py

# Build all 11 release layouts from their XLSX files
python3 scripts/build_layouts.py

# Build code-map CSVs (one-time)
python3 scripts/build_codemaps.py

# Parse data for one release
python3 scripts/parse_data.py calendar_2025

# Parse all 11 releases (~90 seconds total)
python3 scripts/parse_data.py

# Load everything into BigQuery (idempotent; ~5-10 min for full dataset)
python3 scripts/load_bq.py                       # to dataset `plfs`
python3 scripts/load_bq.py --dataset plfs_dev    # to a dev dataset
python3 scripts/load_bq.py --release calendar_2025  # one release only
python3 scripts/load_bq.py --dims-only           # just dims + registry
python3 scripts/load_bq.py --dry-run             # build parquet locally, no upload
```

## 7. How to add a new release

1. Add an entry to `RELEASES` in [`scripts/releases.py`](scripts/releases.py) —
   fill in catalog URL, format (`annual`/`calendar`), period, weight rule,
   paths, byte totals, section row bounds, file names.
2. Place the source XLSX in `raw/docs_<release_id>/` and the data files in
   `raw/data_<release_id>/` (or wherever the config points).
3. `python3 scripts/build_layouts.py <release_id>` — verify byte totals match.
4. `python3 scripts/parse_data.py <release_id>` — verify row counts match
   the release's README.
5. `python3 scripts/releases.py` — regenerate the registry CSV.
6. `python3 scripts/weights.py` — confirm calibration self-test passes
   (weighted total population should be ~1.1-1.2B for any new release).

## 8. Data fetch (gated by microdata.gov.in)

Most PLFS data is behind a free MoSPI login. Catalog URLs are in
[`clean/releases.csv`](clean/releases.csv). Three usable paths:

- **Browser**: each catalog page has a "Get Microdata" tab → log in → download
- **`mospi-unitdata` Python client**: authenticated API. Newer releases give
  CSVs directly; older releases give Nesstar archives.
- **Nesstar archives** (older releases): extract via a cloud Windows VM or
  Wine on macOS. See §3 above.

## 9. Code maps

Every coded column in a clean data table joins to a code map in
[`codemaps/`](codemaps/) on the `code` column. Codes are stored as
zero-padded text.

Notable maps:

- **Geography**: `state.csv` (36 states/UTs), `district.csv` (~700 districts)
- **Demographics**: `religion.csv`, `social_group.csv`, `general_education.csv`, `technical_education.csv`
- **Activity**: `activity_status.csv` (UPS / USS / CWS shared codes)
- **Employment**: `enterprise_type.csv`, `job_contract.csv`, `social_security.csv`
- **Industry (NIC 2008)**: `nic_division.csv`, `nic_group.csv`, `nic_class.csv`, `nic_subclass.csv`
- **Occupation (NCO 2015)**: `nco_division.csv`, `nco_subdivision.csv`, `nco_group.csv`, `nco_family.csv`, `nco_full.csv`

## 10. Weights

See [WEIGHTS.md](WEIGHTS.md). Four rules across releases:

- **`combined`** — `mult / no_qtr / IF(nss = nsc, 100, 200)`. Standard rule.
  Used by all annual releases + CY2022 + CY2024.
- **`half_yearly`** — same as combined but with an extra `/2`. CY2023 only
  (half-yearly panel design).
- **`simple`** — `mult / 100`. CY2025 only (redesigned weight scheme).
- **`limited`** — CY2021 omits `tedu_lvl`/`pas`/`ind_pas`/`ern_reg` from the
  schedule. Usable only for demographic and CWS analyses.

The canonical implementation lives in [`scripts/weights.py`](scripts/weights.py):

```python
from weights import get_weight_fn
weight_fn = get_weight_fn('calendar_2023')
total = sum(weight_fn(row) for row in csv.DictReader(f))
```

Per-release `weight_rule` is recorded in [`clean/releases.csv`](clean/releases.csv).

## 11. BigQuery

Six tables in the `plfs` dataset, populated by
[`scripts/load_bq.py`](scripts/load_bq.py):

| Table | Rows | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `plfs.persons` | ~10.5M | All releases unioned. `weight_annual` pre-computed. `hh_id` joins to households. `ind_pas_div` (2-digit NIC prefix) and `*_label` columns for the common enums are denormalized inline. |
| `plfs.households` | ~2.5M | `weight_annual`, `hh_id`, and `mpce = hce_tot/hh_size` pre-computed. |
| `plfs.releases` | 11 | Registry: catalog IDs, URLs, weight rules, period bounds. |
| `plfs.dim_nco` | ~2.7k | Full NCO 2015 occupation hierarchy in one wide table (division → subdivision → group → family → full). |
| `plfs.dim_nic` | ~1.3k | Full NIC 2008 industry hierarchy in one wide table (division → group → class → subclass). |
| `plfs.dim_geo` | ~700 | State + district. (State name is also inline on the facts.) |

Labels for the small enums (sex, sector, religion, marital_status, education
levels, activity_status, enterprise_type, social_security, job_contract, etc.)
are denormalized as `*_label` columns on the fact tables rather than separate
dim tables. Pattern matches `etl-next/production/`: a small number of
well-shaped fact/dim tables, not a per-enum snowflake.

Typical query:

```sql
SELECT release_year,
       SUM(weight_annual) / 1e6 AS engg_grads_millions,
       APPROX_QUANTILES(ern_reg, 100)[OFFSET(50)] AS median_wage
FROM plfs.persons
WHERE tedu_lvl IN ('03','13')   -- engineering degree
  AND age BETWEEN 20 AND 24
  AND pas = '31'                -- regular salaried
GROUP BY release_year ORDER BY release_year;
```

The load script is idempotent (`WRITE_TRUNCATE`), reproducible, and runs in
~5-10 minutes for the full 10.5M-row dataset. Re-run whenever a new PLFS
release lands.
